The training datasets reside in this directory.
We use Flickr30k in this project. You can download it in two ways:

1. Go to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eeshawn/flickr30k
    - download the dataset and unzip it into a folder (e.g. `flickr30k')

2. Run the script `download_flickr30k.sh` from the terminal
    - this will download the dataset and unzip it autmatically
